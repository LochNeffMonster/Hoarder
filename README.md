A game for CS 179 about collecting objects.

The game is a first-person, mouse-look, WASD controlled game about taking objects from other houses and putting them in yours.

"You have just moved into the neighborhood and you've never owned a house before. 
Maybe your new neighbors would be willing to let you have some of their things?"

Avoid getting caught or else people will start to get suspicious which will make it harder to acquire new furnishings.
